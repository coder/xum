/**
 * Chat-view first-paint readiness barrier.
 *
 * CONTRACT — "unknown is not empty": the chat view must reveal once, fully
 * formed. Any async data source that can change the chat view's INITIAL
 * layout (composer-dock decorations, dock-internal banners) must:
 *
 *   1. distinguish "not yet loaded" from "known empty" (a store default that
 *      renders as "decoration absent" hides the difference and guarantees a
 *      pop-in when the real data lands after first paint), and
 *   2. register its known-signal in this hook.
 *
 * ChatPane holds the transcript-hydration skeleton and suppresses the
 * decoration lane until every source is known (see computeChatViewReveal), so
 * the transcript and all decorations mount in one commit — layout can never
 * shift because a decoration "loaded in" a few frames after the user started
 * reading. Sources resolve in parallel with (and almost always faster than)
 * the chat history replay, so the barrier adds no perceptible latency.
 *
 * Sources that DON'T need registration:
 *   - synchronous reads (localStorage reviews, workspace metadata);
 *   - chat-history-derived state (todos, queued message) — it flips in the
 *     same caught-up commit that reveals the transcript;
 *   - event-driven UI that is deterministically absent at first paint
 *     (context-switch warnings, edit indicators).
