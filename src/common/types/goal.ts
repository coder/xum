 *   - `active`   — the (at most one) goal the agent is currently driving.
 *                  May itself be running / paused / budget-limited — see
 *                  `GoalActiveMode` below for that sub-status.
 *   - `complete` — agent or user marked it done.
 *
 *   - `upcoming` — queued behind the active goal; the user has lined
 *                  this up next but the agent is not yet driving it.
 *   - `archived` — the user manually stashed this (after completion, or
 *                  to deprioritize without losing the context). Hidden
 *                  from the agent and from auto-promotion.
 *
 * The storage enum (`GoalStatus`) does NOT carry `upcoming` / `archived`
 * — those live on the per-workspace `goal-board.json` side table so the
 * existing single-goal `goal.json` storage and agent contract stay
 * unchanged. The UI gets the lifecycle by combining sources via
 * `GoalBoardSection` instead of squinting at one flat enum.

 *                        intervention, explicit pause), or safety gates such as
 *                        an interrupted stream. Continuations are suppressed
 *                        until the user resumes.
 *   - `budget_limited` — internal-only transient state set by the budget
 *                        gate when cost or turn caps are hit.
