/**
 * Sandbox Host Service (substrate 3 of the shared agent foundation).
 *
 * One home for QuickJS guest hosting with two mount lifetimes:
 * - `ephemeral`: per-call, behaviorally identical to the pre-service
 *   code_execution flow (create → eval → dispose).
 * - `persistent`: per-workspace-session; the runtime survives across
 *   code_execution calls and turns, is disposed on workspace archive/reset,
 *   and exposes a guest-visible `vars` namespace whose JSON-serializable
 *   contents the host snapshots via the journal kit (contract: data only —
 *   functions/closures are not captured).
 *
 * Persistent mounts also get:
 * - an async capability bridge (runtime.registerPromiseFunction) — used by
 *   Track 2 for `mux.task({background:true})`-style handles;
 * - host→guest event delivery: a queue drained from the guest via the global
 *   `drainHostEvents()` (queue + drain model, no interrupts).
 *
 * WorkflowRunner intentionally keeps constructing runtimes through
 * IJSRuntimeFactory directly: its replay-safety must not regress, and it
 * already consumes the same abstract interface (migration note per handoff).
