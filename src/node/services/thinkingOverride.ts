/**
 * Mid-turn thinking-level override state.

 * One holder object is created per turn by AgentSession (at durable turn
 * acceptance) and threaded BY REFERENCE down through AIService into
 * StreamManager's request config — the same shared-mutable-state pattern as
 * ToolSearchStreamState. The renderer's thinking slider writes `pending` via
 * AgentSession.setActiveTurnThinkingLevel; StreamManager consumes it at the
 * next prepareStep (which runs before every model step, including step 1, so
 * changes during the PREPARING window apply to the turn's first request).
 *
 * Node-runtime-local: carries a callback, so it does not belong in
 * src/common/types (never crosses IPC).
