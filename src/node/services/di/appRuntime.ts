/**
 * App-lifetime Effect runtime (Effect migration Phase 11) — and the durable
 * **DI contract** for the Layer graph it builds.
 *
 * A `ManagedRuntime` built from the process's Layer graph: `./layers/app.ts`
 * (`AppLive`) for `ServiceContainer` roots (desktop, `xum server`, ACP,
 * tests/ipc), `CoreLive` alone for the headless CLI roots (`xum run`,
 * `xum workflow`, via `coreServicesRoot.ts`). It owns the app-lifetime
 * `Scope`, its built `Context<AppTags>` is what oRPC Effect-native handlers
 * receive as `"effect/context"`, and it is the source of the two runtime seams
 * described below. Service classes were not rewritten for this: Layers are
 * thin adapters around the existing constructors, and the former composition
 * roots' setter/listener wiring lives in `CoreWiringLive`/`DesktopWiringLive`
 * in the original statement order.
 *
 * ## Invariants (Phase 11 compatibility contract, not permanent law)
 *
 * - **I1 — Synchronous layer bodies.** Every Layer in the graph builds without
 *   suspending (`Layer.succeed`/`Layer.sync`/`Layer.effect` over sync effects;
 *   `acquireRelease` with a sync acquire is fine). `makeAppRuntime` builds the
 *   graph eagerly with `runSync` and asserts that it completed, so a layer that
 *   suspends fails right here — at construction, exactly where a throwing
 *   service constructor failed before, i.e. inside every entry point's
 *   existing startup catch path (`desktop/main.ts` "Startup Failed" dialog,
 *   `cli/server.ts`/ACP log-and-exit). Asynchronous acquisition belongs in
 *   `ServiceContainer.initialize()` / startup effects or a future explicit
 *   async factory root, never silently inside a layer. Eager building also
 *   sets `cachedContext`, so every `runtime.runX` is `Effect.run…With(context)`
 *   and a fiber started through it runs synchronously up to its first async
 *   boundary (the sync-start fact the codebase's deterministic-winner funnels
 *   rely on; pinned in `effectRunner.test.ts`).
 * - **I2 — Services never hold the `ManagedRuntime`.** After `dispose()` every
 *   `runX` on it dies with "ManagedRuntime disposed", so a late worker callback
 *   would defect. Workers hold an `EffectRunner` (`./effectRunner.ts`,
 *   default `defaultEffectRunner` = the global `Effect.runX`) whose `runX` is
 *   `Effect.run…With(ctx)` — same sync-start semantics, still valid after the
 *   runtime is gone. Supervision, when needed, is explicit via
 *   `AppFiberScope` (`./appFiberScope.ts`).
 * - **I3 — Per-call pipelines are untouched.** `Effect.runPromise(this.effects…)`
 *   facades and the `memoryConsolidationService` check-and-reserve funnels are
 *   not routed through DI; no lookup, runner call, or `await` may be inserted
 *   before `inFlight.set` / `harvestInFlight.set`. Only lifecycle forks in the
 *   clock-driven workers (heartbeat, idle compaction, retry backoff,
 *   `StreamManager.schedulePartialWrite`) go through `this.runner.runX`.
 * - **I4 — Signatures unchanged.** Constructors, Promise facades, private
 *   methods (spy seams) and module exports keep their shapes; a runner is an
 *   optional trailing constructor parameter defaulting to `defaultEffectRunner`.
 * - **I5 — No layer finalizers.** Teardown order stays explicit in
 *   `ServiceContainer.dispose()`/`shutdown()` and the CLI cleanup lists; layer
 *   bodies and wiring layers are `Effect.sync`-only and register no finalizers
 *   or forks, so `disposeAppRuntime` (the last step) reorders nothing. The one
 *   supervised resource, `AppFiberScope`, is closed at a fixed early position
 *   (see "Shutdown order").
 * - **I6 — Construction order is declared, never implied.** Wiring layers
 *   replay the former roots' setter/listener statements in order; a
 *   constructor may touch only its *declared* dependencies (built earlier by
 *   staging). Dependency order is expressed only with `Layer.provide` /
 *   `Layer.provideMerge` stages — never through `Layer.mergeAll` argument
 *   order, whose siblings may build in any order.
 * - **I7 — In-process only.** DI changes no persisted data, IPC wire shapes, or
 *   oRPC handler bodies (beyond the `effect/context` source).
 * - **I8 — One set of Layer definitions per service.** Every process root
 *   builds from the same layers (`CoreLive` is shared by `AppLive` and the CLI
 *   root). Unit harnesses (`createTestHistoryService`, `createTestToolConfig`,
 *   `createAgentSessionHarness`, …) intentionally bypass Layers and construct
 *   services directly.
 *
 * **R6 firewall.** In production code `Layer`, `ManagedRuntime` and
 * `TestClock` are imported only under `src/node/services/di/`, and every
 * `Context.Service` tag is declared there (`di/tags.ts`, plus the two seam
 * tags in `effectRunner.ts`/`appFiberScope.ts`; `orpc/effectContext.ts`
 * re-exports `MemoryMeta` and builds a narrow test-only context), so an effect
 * RC rename touches one directory. Tests may inject a `TestClock` beneath the
 * real graph (`serviceContainer.test.ts`) but go through `di/` helpers.
 *
 * ## Two seams, deliberately asymmetric
 *
 * - `EffectRunner` is **unsupervised**: fibers forked through it belong to the
 *   worker's own `Scope` (explicit `start()`/`stop()`, which stay synchronous
 *   because those fibers suspend only on the clock). Neither
 *   `closeScopeBounded(appFiberScope)` nor `disposeAppRuntime` interrupts or
 *   awaits them (pinned in `appFiberScope.test.ts`). Its `R = never` signature
 *   is what makes "not a service locator" a type error rather than a review
 *   item, and what lets a worker run on a `TestClock` (`./testEffectRunner.ts`).
 * - `AppFiberScope` is **supervised**: a child of the runtime's layer scope;
 *   fibers forked into it with `Effect.forkIn` are interrupted *and awaited*
 *   by `closeScopeBounded` early in `dispose()`, while every dependency they
 *   might touch during finalization is still alive. No production occupant in
 *   Phase 11; the first candidate is the streamManager engine core. **Rule for
 *   occupants:** tolerate interruption at any suspension point, do not depend
 *   on resources torn down before step 2 below, and never fork long-lived I/O
 *   work through `EffectRunner` expecting shutdown to await it.
 *
 * ## Shutdown order (`ServiceContainer.dispose()`, one shared teardown behind
 * a latch so concurrent/repeated calls — the desktop's two `before-quit`
 * listeners, tests' dispose-then-shutdown — await the same sequence)
 *
 * 1. `backgroundProcessManager.beginShutdown()` — first; the latch that keeps
 *    persisted armed-monitor records from being erased by session teardown.
 * 2. `closeScopeBounded(appFiberScope, APP_FIBER_SCOPE_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MS)`.
 * 3. The explicit sequence verbatim (`desktopBridgeServer.stop()` …
 *    `terminateAll()` … `timelineService.flush()` last), each step timed as a
 *    `[shutdown] <step> {ms}` debug line (`shutdownStep.ts`).
 * 4. `disposeAppRuntime(runtime, APP_RUNTIME_DISPOSE_TIMEOUT_MS)` — last; also
 *    re-closes `AppFiberScope` idempotently as a backstop.
 * Both bounded teardowns share `boundedTeardown` below: `Effect.uninterruptible`
 * shell, detached close fiber, `Effect.interruptible` join + `Effect.timeout`,
 * defects folded into `log.warn`, never rejects. Budget: the two bounds
 * (`APP_FIBER_SCOPE_CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MS` + `APP_RUNTIME_DISPOSE_TIMEOUT_MS`,
 * `src/constants/terminationTimeouts.ts`) must add up to less than the callers'
 * outer quit budgets (`desktop/main.ts` before-quit race, `cli/server.ts`
 * force-exit timer), which stay the last line of defense. The CLI roots
 * (`xum run`/`xum workflow`) mirror steps 1, 2 and 4 in
 * their best-effort cleanup lists (`cli/runCleanup.ts`). `shutdown()` never
 * touches the runtime or `AppFiberScope`. Crash paths (`uncaughtException`,
 * SIGKILL) run no finalizers; durable state must stay crash-safe without them.
 *
 * ## Cost of the Layer machinery (recorded per PR; R7/R8)
 *
 * `[startup] AppRuntime built` grew 4 ms (PR 1, one layer) → 11 ms (PR 3,
 * coarse core) → 18 → 23 ms (PR 4a/4b, 19 core layers + 8 stages + wiring) and
 * reads 16–24 ms for the whole graph in `xum server`. Cold `new
 * ServiceContainer(stores)` went 27 → 35 ms when the six desktop group layers
 * + three composition nodes replaced the imperative constructor (PR 5:
 * ≈ +8 ms cold / +0.3 ms warm for ~40 services; a `provideMerge`-only chain
 * costs the same, so the cost is Effect first-use per layer, not sibling
 * concurrency). `make typecheck` stayed flat (±4 %). Group layers, not
 * per-service layers, are therefore the right granularity for tails whose
 * teardown is hand-tuned anyway.
 *
 * ## Deliberately not done in Phase 11
 *
 * `initialize()` as a Layer/startup effect (would break I1's failure
 * semantics), layer finalizers for the existing `dispose()` steps (I5),
 * `streamBridge` on the runtime, per-service optional tags (optional
 * cross-cutting services stay optional via `CoreOptionsTag`), the streamManager
 * engine core as the first `AppFiberScope` occupant.
