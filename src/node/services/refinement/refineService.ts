 * (backend refuses when off), one-run-at-a-time-per-workspace locking
 * (concurrent invocations are REJECTED, not queued — an explicit /refine has
 * nothing to gain from running twice over the same trajectory), trajectory
 * assembly (recent chat.jsonl + timeline events when the Timeline experiment

 * v1 tradeoff (intentional, no proposal/approval UI): edits are auto-applied
 * and the summary row points at the r6 rollback paths ("bun run debug
 * refinements" / the refinement_rollback tool). Approval UX would double the
 * surface of an experimental feature whose every edit is already journaled
 * with a byte-exact inverse — cheap rollback is the safety mechanism.
 *
 * Failure posture: best-effort everywhere below the run result. Summary-row
 * append or emission failures log and continue (self-healing doctrine); a
 * stream failure returns an error so the user knows the pass did not finish.
