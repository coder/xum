**Usage notes:**
- \`xum.*\` functions are synchronous—do not use \`await\`. \`mux.*\` is a compatibility alias.
- Use \`return\` to provide a final result to the model
- Use \`console.log/warn/error\` for debugging - output is captured
- Results are JSON-serialized; non-serializable values return \`{ error: "..." }\`
- On failure, partial results (completed tool calls) are returned for debugging${persistentKernelNotes}
