  /**
   * Treat an agent's text-only `goal_continuation` turn as implicit

   * `complete_goal` explicitly, but real models sometimes finish with a
   * plain text "looks done" reply instead. Without this fallback the
   * continuation loop would re-fire on the same idle output until budget
   * or cooldown gates intervene.
   *
   * AgentSession owns the "no tool calls + goalKind === continuation"
   * predicate (it has the stream parts + activeStreamContext in scope);
   * this method re-reads goal state and only acts when the goal is
   * currently `active`. `budget_limited` is intentionally out-of-scope —
   * its one-shot wrap-up flow owns terminal text turns. `paused` /
   * `complete` / missing goals also fall through.
   *
   * Errors from the underlying `setGoal` (e.g. a concurrent clear/replace
   * surfacing as `goal_conflict`, or a status flip racing with the read)
   * are logged and swallowed so the stream-end handler never throws on
   * this best-effort path.
   *
   * **Auto-promotion of upcoming goals.** When the workspace has queued
   * upcoming goals, the inline `setGoal({ status: "complete" })` call
   * triggers `maybeAutoPromoteOnComplete`, but that helper skips while
   * `isWorkspaceStreaming` is still true — and at stream-end the
   * `extensionMetadata.setStreaming(false)` update is asynchronous, so
   * the skip is likely. We therefore re-run the deferred auto-promote
   * pass (`runDeferredAutoPromoteAfterStreamEnd`) after a successful
   * completion. This is the same hook `applyPendingAfterStreamEnd`
   * already uses for the parallel "agent called `complete_goal`
   * mid-stream" case (#3326 Codex P2 PRRT_kwDOPxxmWM6DMh9j); without
   * it the next upcoming goal stays stuck in `upcoming` until some
   * later manual mutation.
