 * at module scope. WorkspaceService registers a guard reporting workspaces an agent-driven
 * archive is currently gating (or that are already archived); workflow start/resume entry
 * points acquire an admission in the same synchronous block that checks the guard. Whichever
 * side runs first is observed by the other: an armed archive gate refuses new workflow
 * admissions, while a held admission (or an in-process runner registered at lease
 * acquisition) is observed by the archive sink via hasInProcessWorkflowWork before it
 * persists archivedAt.
