/**
 * Managed Agent Plugin installer (agent-plugins experiment; global scope only).
 *
 * Flow: parse input → shallow clone to a staging dir under ~/.mux →
 * validate the STAGED clone with the same manifest/component discovery used
 * at runtime → return a consent preview → on confirm, re-clone the exact SHA,
 * promote into ~/.mux/plugins/<name>, and record a registry entry
 * ({source, ref, lockedSha}) in ~/.mux/plugins.json.
 *
 * The registry is a standalone file (NOT a config.json section): older builds
 * rebuild config.json from known fields on save, so a downgrade would drop an
 * embedded registry — and owning the file lets writes THROW on failure so
 * install/update/uninstall can roll back instead of silently succeeding with
 * an unpersisted registry.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The installer NEVER writes into a project checkout (v1 is global-only).
 * - `lockedSha` is what runs; branches are only a tracking channel for the
 *   update badge. Nothing auto-applies.
 * - Update = temp clone + wholesale directory swap (rename-old → promote-new
 *   → delete-old), never in-place `git pull` — local edits to a managed
 *   plugin dir are discarded on update.
 * - Applying an update or uninstalling recycles that plugin's running MCP
 *   servers: content can change behind an unchanged stdio command line, so
 *   the config-signature check cannot notice (correctness, not polish).
 * - Failure paths must leave no partial state: staging dirs are cleaned up,
 *   and promote + registry-write failures roll back.

 *   an orphaned tree that discovery lists as unmanaged, assertNoCollision
 *   blocks, and uninstall refuses — recoverable only by manual deletion.
 * - UPDATE: the OLD live tree moved into staging but the staged replacement
 *   is not yet promoted. The registry then records an install whose path is
 *   missing, and retrying Update cannot self-heal because
 *   assertNoCapabilityIncrease treats the missing tree as an empty surface.
 * - UNINSTALL: the plugin tree (and optionally its data dir) is staged into
