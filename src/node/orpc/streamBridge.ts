/**
 * Effect Stream bridge for oRPC subscription procedures (Effect migration
 * Phase 9).
 *
 * Adapts the EventEmitter-style subscription seam (attach listener → push
 * events → detach) that `routerSubscriptions.ts` handlers use into an Effect
 * Stream pipeline, then re-exposes it as the `AsyncGenerator` wire shape oRPC
 * event-iterator procedures expect. Wire behavior (payload shapes, ordering,
 * completion/error semantics) is intentionally identical to the previous
 * `asyncIterableFromSubscription` seam.
 *
 * Design invariants:
 *
 * - **Foreign-callsite emissions**: producers fire from non-Effect contexts
 *   (EventEmitter callbacks, AI-SDK callbacks). `emit.push` is a synchronous
 *   `Queue.offerUnsafe` — the value lands in the buffer before `push` returns,
 *   with no fiber suspension between the producer's emit and the queue offer.
 *   This preserves emit-after-durable-write ordering guarantees (e.g. memory
 *   consolidation emits `statusChange` synchronously after its durable write;
 *   subscribers must observe events in exactly that order).
 * - **Guaranteed teardown**: listener detach runs via `Effect.acquireRelease`
 *   (one acquireRelease per resource), tied to the stream's scope. The scope
 *   closes on client disconnect (AbortSignal → iterator close → fiber
 *   interruption), on consumer `return()`, on stream failure, and on natural
 *   completion — so `off()`/`removeListener()` is guaranteed on every exit
 *   path.
 * - **Interruption posture**: subscription streams are interruptible by
 *   design. Client aborts interrupt the pull fiber at the next suspension
 *   point; there is no in-flight mutation to protect, only listener handles,
 *   which the scope finalizers release.
 * - **Defect folding**: bridge-internal failures (validate/subscribe throws,
 *   initialize/initial rejections, onEnd errors) fail the pull, which
 *   surfaces as a rejection of the consumer's `next()` — the same observable
 *   contract as the previous async-generator seam. Nothing escapes as an
 *   unhandled rejection.
 * - **Laziness**: nothing (not even `validate`) runs until the consumer's
 *   first `next()` call, matching async-generator semantics.
